# Project Description
ACW02-ZB is an open-source Zigbee-enabled HVAC controller for the AIRTON (to replace ACW02 WiFi module) series and compatible units. It allows full integration with Zigbee2MQTT, Home Assistant, and other Zigbee ecosystems, providing remote control, monitoring, and diagnostics for air conditioning systems.

### Key Features
- **Zigbee 3.0 End Device**: Compatible with ESP32-C6 and ESP32-H2
- **Full HVAC Control**: Supports on/off, mode, setpoints, fan speed, swing, eco, night, mute, and display
- **Error Diagnostics**: Exposes AC error codes and status via Zigbee attributes (!!! Feature not yet validated)
- **Automatic Polling**: Uses Z2M's generic polling framework for unreportable attributes
- **Auto-Rejoin**: Device automatically rejoins Zigbee network after removal or network loss
- **Clean Entity Names**: Optimized for Home Assistant and Zigbee2mqtt UI
- **Factory Reset**: Long-press boot button 5s for full reset
- **Open Hardware**: PCB and schematic files will be included

### Architecture
- **Firmware**: ESP-IDF C code for Zigbee stack, HVAC protocol, and attribute mapping
- **External Converter**: Custom Zigbee2MQTT JS converter for multi-endpoint mapping and polling

### Typical Use Cases
- Integrate AIRTON (to replace ACW02 WiFi module) with Home Assistant via Zigbee2MQTT
- Monitor and control HVAC remotely (mode, temperature, fan, swing, eco, etc.)
- Receive error codes and filter status for maintenance
- Automatic recovery from network disruptions

### Getting Started
1. Flash ESP32-C6/H2 with provided firmware
2. Add external converter to Zigbee2MQTT
3. Pair device and configure entities in Home Assistant
4. Use Z2M UI or automations for full control and monitoring

See the documentation files for advanced features, troubleshooting, and hardware details.
